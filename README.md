LEARNING PYTHON BIT BY BIT

Have learned the Syntax, Operators and Some Built in Functions.

The Program is a Simple Calculator capable of adding, Subtracting, Multiplying and Dividing two Numbers.

In Calc3 have added the while loop to facilitate iteration.

In Calc4, the inputs are received from the User and  also the while loop is implemented too.
